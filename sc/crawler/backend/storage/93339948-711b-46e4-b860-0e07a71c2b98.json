Customer onboarding is a term that describes the process a user goes through when they start journey as a customer of the product or service your company offers. The process plays a key role in determining the ongoing relationship your customer will have with that product or service. It is a critical part of the customer journey.  There is a saying that goes, \u201cyou never get a second chance to make a good first impression.\u201d What better way to make a first impression and showcase from the start the type of experience a customer can expect from your organization? If done incorrectly and without thought, it can destroy interest and trust between your company and potential customers. A successful program nurtures the customer. It shows them that your business will look out for their interests and individual needs. The goal is to build long-term relationships with customers. It is a process that should move customers through various stages of the customer journey with thoughtfulness. First, customers will be engaged with your product or service. Then they will build a relationship with your company. From there, they will move into the loyalty stage. An outstanding onboarding program should excel at fostering this customer journey. We live in a digital world where we can receive the world at our fingertips. Information is available at lightning speed, delivering anything and everything a user could want in seconds. The advancement of the internet has created an expectation from the general public that they should receive everything at this lightning-fast speed. Slow and complicated sign-up processes can scare away potential customers from building a relationship with your business due to this expectation.  Banks and financial institutionsmust pay special attention to their sign-up process. They must follow strictKnow Your Customer (KYC)andAnti-Money Laundering (AML)procedures during the creation of a customer account. They must do this to prevent financial crime, terrorist financing or money laundering. Nevertheless, steps must be taken to simplify this process while also maintaining compliance. A balance must be struck between obtaining user information and creating a smooth onboarding process. Otherwise, many financial institutions will be left in the dust as consumers lean toward competitors with more streamlined customer acquisition processes. Easing potential customers to use your product or service is critical for building brand trust. Do this effectively, and your company will create customers that fully engage and use your product. This will reduce the amount of customer abandonment as well. With more customers using your product or service, this will inevitably increase your revenue. That way, you can reinvest that money into creating great experiences for your customers throughout their journey as your customer.

{"url": "https://www.idmerit.com/behavior-monitoring/", "title": "User Behavior Monitoring Solutions Provider | IDMERIT", "meta": {"description": "IDMERIT's behavior monitoring solutions assist organizations in user behavior tracking and identifying suspicious activities based on unnatural patterns.", "keywords": ""}, "content": "Detect, track and stop risky behavior before it affects your business.  IDMERIT offers a seamless system for behavioral biometrics. It is a type of biometric technology that measures the unique identifying patterns associated with human behavior. It is different than physical biometrics, which involves measuring innate human characteristics. Behavioral biometrics are generally passive in nature and do not require active participation by the user. They can assess how well people understand the information they are entering. They can also detect how familiar a user is with the application they are using. As the demand for rich online user experience increases, the use of behavior monitoring with biometrics among companies has increased as well. A variety of different industries could benefit from authenticating users with behavior monitoring, such as financial institutions, cryptocurrency exchanges, government agencies, online gaming companies, retailers, and other businesses. There are a variety of different behavior biometrics including: Biometric credentials must be kept secure to prevent identity theft. Because of this, biometric data is encrypted during gathering and verification. When biometric data is gathered, the software determines various data points to be used for matching purposes. The match points are processed with an algorithm that translates the data to numeric values. The values are stored in a database and compared with the biometric input from a user. If a user matches the numerical points in the database, then they will pass the biometric authentication process. Gathering information on user behavior does not require special software. Most of the time, users can have their data collected with the hardware they already have, such as a smartphone or desktop computer. Software must be deployed to analyze the biometric data, but this is simple to acquire. This makes device behavior monitoring a cost effective and easy solution to implement within an identity verification service. This technology has grown in popularity because it can solve some of the problems that other cybersecurity measures cannot. Cybercriminals proved repeatedly that they can bypass many traditional forms of authentication\u2014PINs, passwords, device IDs, tokens, geolocation verification, and physical biometrics. Customer device discrepancies are not just monitored during customer login points, they are tracked and updated throughout the customer\u2019s online journey. It is difficult to impersonate another person, making it a solution that is hard for criminals to overcome. The use of behavioral biometrics is growing among financial institutions over voice, fingerprint, iris, or other static data to authenticate customers. By implementing an identity solution that also tracks customer device usage and behavior, banks can more effectively monitor true customer from fraudsters. They can detect many things: from the movements on a keyboard to the angle at which a customer holds a device. The Software can collect all this data and analyze it to build a behavioral library of a user. All this data will add robustness to the due diligence of fraud mitigation. Many customers report they prefer biometric authentication methods over other security measures, such as having to remember a password. Customers fear the security of their personal data and trust that biometrics are more secure because they are more difficult to replicate. Since this technology requires no extra effort from customers, this makes it an easy solution to implement. Overall, this technology can increase account security for customers, reduce risk and mitigate fraud and provide a more robust multifactorial identity verification solution. Combining behavioral monitoring with other solutions will increase your security measures. By performing behavioral biometrics as a secondary security measure, you can determine with more certainty if your customers are who they say they are. You can discover criminals who bypassed other security measures with this solution. This multi-layered approach will protect your business from fraud and mitigate risk.

Amid the transformation of the digital world, telecom companies are at the forefront of this change. The growth of smartphones has increased our ability to connect and deliver content anywhere on the planet. This phenomenon is making it easier for people to rely on their cell phones for much more than just making phone calls. Telecommunication companies are experiencing large-scale changes to their industry and the world as we know it. Few other industries are as competitive as telecom. With a relentless drive to acquire more customers and market share, fraud detection, and management is often an afterthought. This tactic is dangerous, because identity fraud can cost telecom companies huge sums of money \u2013 and expose them to large amounts of risks. Millions of people worldwide now have access to a globally connected network\u2014aka the Internet. This has created digital inclusion around the world. New opportunities are changing the way consumers and companies interact online. In the midst of this change, telecom companies are working diligently to handle changing customer expectations. Customers now expect more innovative services at a mobile level that are convenient and easy to use. Telecom companies are decreasing their margins, increasing competition, and actively looking for ways to stay relevant and profitable.  As technology advances, global information continues to flow at an increasing rate. This is creating new risks for data privacy, fraud protection, and security. Criminals often use fabricated identities to secure telecom services. This type of telecom fraud involves identity theft or the use of fabricated identities during onboarding. This enables criminals to use telecom services such as TV, internet services, mobile banking, virtual wallets, and other high-value services for more fraudulent applications. Regulators are becoming increasingly interested in the telecom industry to help fight against the nefarious use of mobile devices for terrorist attacks or other criminal activities. They are actively pushing for telecom companies to comply with Know Your Customer (KYC) regulations and mandatory SIM card registration.  While telecom companies are starting to realize the strategic impact of effective fraud management, the systems they have purchased are often so complex they cannot be used practically. Even highly trained staff have difficulties using these systems. This is especially true in many developing countries where subscriber verification is now mandatory. Many mobile operators are now working to improve their customer verification process. IDMERIT delivers an automated suite of new subscriber verification tools that can be deployed quickly and seamlessly across your organization during the onboarding process. These products will help your company remain in compliance with regulations, maintain security and actively fight against fraud. The results we deliver are cost effective, low risks, and highly efficient. IDMkycis an identity verification solution that offers to make the onboarding process for new subscribers seamless. The secure API takes information imputed by a new user and crosschecks it against information stored in global, official data sources. This solution will allow any telecom provider to streamline the customer identification process. This will reduce account abandonment and lead to more subscribers. IDMscanis a more robust identity verification tool offered by IDMERIT. It can also make the onboarding process seamless for new subscribers by offering instant identity verification. A customer simply needs to scan an official identity document\u2014driver\u2019s license, national ID or passport\u2014for validation. The ID will be validated and from there it will connect to IDMkyc to verify that the information on the document is legitimate. It will also require a user to perform a biometric scan for further validation. Through this multi-channel authentication process, a telecom provider can be confident that new users are actually who they say they are. Both IDMkyc and IDMscan use an automated process to complete identity checks. This process ensures that consumer data remains secure and is not put in danger. Identity theft is a real threat to consumers and telecom providers must remain diligent to mitigate this risk to consumers.

In online gambling scenarios, it is illegal for minors to play. Online casinos are responsible to uphold these laws and make sure they are enforced. Otherwise, they risk heavy fines for noncompliance with underage gambling laws. Age verification is a key component of identity verification, so introducing these solutions into an online gambling platform is a no-brainer.

Our low-cost solution will help you meet your compliance and due diligence goals and also protect your company\u2019s bottom line.  Know Your Customer (KYC) verification is critical in online gaming. Online gaming facilitates a customer, not a present environment, making it essential for gaming companies to verify their users. Doing this will ensure that users are of age to play certain games; furthermore, it will prevent fraudsters from having access to a game. Secure Payment Processing As an online gaming merchant, making sure your payment systems are compliant with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) is an immense responsibility. IDMERIT provides solutions that can minimize that task. Gaming companies must ensure that when payment processing takes place, it occurs from legitimate individuals.

Identity verification solutions can help meet these goals by offering comprehensive solutions that will prevent nefarious characters from running fraudulent credit card transactions. The online gaming sector has grown exponentially in recent years and is expected to keep growing. Online gambling and eSports are becoming more common, leaders to this trend. With the great rewards of potential payouts that motivate online gamers come great risks of identity theft, fraud, and data breaches. IDMERIT\u2019s online gaming solutions will help your company mitigate these risks, so you can protect both your reputation and bottom line. Our global API is a comprehensive source of identity information. This solution could be used to authenticate that the information a user provides during onboarding is accurate and legitimate.

This is especially important in age-restricted content scenarios like online gambling. IDMscan scans identity documents like national IDs, driver\u2019s licenses and passports to verify that the identity document is real. It also connects to IDMkyc to validate that the information on the identity document as well. This can help prevent fraudsters from using a stolen identity to enter a gaming environment. It can also prevent minors from sneaking into an online gambling environment. IDMdevice leverages device data to determine if a specific device is at risk of performing fraud. The software analyzes a variety of different device information to determine if the device has patterns suggesting it will commit fraud. This would allow gaming companies to identify cybercriminals without the use of PII information. The effectiveness and usability of IDMdevice delivers identity checks that are reliable, secure and build trust between parties. Through official data sources, fraudsters are kept at bay while implementing ease of use as the future of identity becomes a reality.

This is because these schemes are typically organized with the intention of committing fraud repeatedly. Some feedback indicates up to 10% of claims spending comes from new enrollees, so it is critical that these new enrollees be verified. Enrollment fraud is found by examining the identities being enrolled.  To determine if your insurance company is dealing with enrollment fraud, you must observe the identities signing up for your services. A best practice is to do this during the onboarding process.

Enrollment fraud does not occur frequently compared to other types of fraud. Regardless, it usually has a larger financial impact than other fraud. This is because long-term fraud is usually committed when enrollment fraud happens. In these cases, fraud is committed various times over the course of time rather than just once. Insurers have a vested interest in verifying that their clients are who they claim to be. Identity theft and identity fraud cost the insurance industry billions per year in extra expenses \u2013 which are then passed on to policyholders in the form of higher premiums.

The ubiquity of healthcare information online has made it very easy to access information including comprehensive files on diagnosis, treatment, and patient\u2019s financial information. This has resulted in greater efficiencies and better patient care. However, it has also presented a massive challenge for companies who access and verify healthcare data, while still maintaining the highest levels of security. Healthcare is one of the fastest growing industries, and it always will be. Healthcare institutions have built up a reputation for lagging claims, mountains of paperwork, and a bureaucratic process that does not complement the experience that patients need and want. This is a big pain point, and we understand. IDMERIT has a simple solution to onboarding.  Onboarding for healthcare services has historically been extremely slow. Patients find it difficult to make it through onboarding procedures in a timely basis. This is often due to slow know your customer (KYC) processes meant to prevent identity theft and patient fraud. IDMERIT can help solve these issues by speeding up the process of authenticating a person\u2019s identity with instant online identity verification services. Without a doubt, access to great healthcare starts from the onboarding process. A quality experience from beginning to end and ongoing care needs to be personal and individualized. Each patient has a unique health identity. To be able to seamlessly verify that identity from registration to discharge requires thousands of hours of manpower. Automated frictionless identify verification is our solution. Let\u2019s look specifically at the cost value of implementing a seamless identity verification system. Minimize payment delays. \u2022 Reduce returned mail, billing costs, and lost invoices by confirming demographic information. With up-to-date demographic information on file, you can minimize payment delays and reduce billing and collection costs. All of this takes place while proactively minimizing identity theft. Prevent identity theft \u2022 By identifying potential cases of identity theft from the initial onboarding, the user can address any discrepancies in records from the start of the process. Lower collection costs \u2022 Follow up on accounts more effectively by ensuring patient contact information is up-to-date and accurate at the front end of the revenue cycle Reduce claims denials \u2022 Updating incorrect demographics, such as name, Social Security Number, and Date of Birth can reduce or eliminate claim denials Protect your organization\u2019s reputation \u2022 Improve the quality and efficiency of service. Identity solutions allow healthcare institutions to improve the onboarding process by eliminating extraneous paperwork and their associated costs. Our solutions can help reduce labor costs, improve the flow of patient information and transactions, and reduce problems like claim rejections owed to wrong or missing information. IDMERIT will help your institution minimize payment delays, reduce billing and collection costs, protect your patients from identity theft, and uphold your organization reputation. Industries worldwide are becoming more digital and paperless; the healthcare system is not an exception. The benefit, incentives, and cost value for implementing a more streamlined onboarding process is clear. IDMERIT\u2019s healthcare solutions provide advanced protection from healthcare fraud and identity abuse. With our platform, you will be able to securely access and share healthcare information quickly and easily for verification. With our up-to-date solutions, you will always be compliant with relevant regulatory standards (HIPAA, HITECH, CLIA.) This will result in gaining the trust of the patients and healthcare providers. IDMERIT uses advanced technologies to verify and validate individual identities. No human review takes place, allowing personally identifiable information (PII) to remain safe. Other providers in the industry use the manual review for their verification processes; furthermore, the reviews often take place overseas, outside of the protections of consumer data regulations. IDMERIT thinks that manual review is an unwise practice because it puts PII at risk. With our secure API, you can ensure that the healthcare data of your patients remains safe and secure. IDMkycis an identity verification tool for people and businesses. Using a secure API, it takes imputed personal information and matches it against data from official data sources in the person or businesses country of origin. All of this happens in real time. This is a low friction solution that helps combat against many different types of fraud. IDMscanis a more robust identity verification tool. Individuals must scan an identity document into the platform for verification. After the ID is verified, IDMscan extracts the information from the scanned ID and uses IDMkyc to crosscheck the data from the identity document. It also requires users to perform a biometric face recognition test to match them with the ID. This product offers increased friction to users for more restricted eCommerce scenarios such as age-restricted commerce. IDMdeviceis a fraud security tool that determines risk without the use of personally identifiable information (PII). IDMdevice analyzes device analytics to figure out the chance a device will be associated with fraud. This happens in the background of a user\u2019s browser and does not affect their experience while shopping on your platform. Using various device factors, it can predict with extreme accuracy if a device is being used for nefarious purposes. It is a solution that provides businesses with protection from fraud without compromising on the customer experience.

Contact Now!", "keywords": ""}, "content": "Identifying people quickly and accurately is important for Border control to let them across borders legally. The world is becoming a more connected and globalized place. On any given day, around eight million people travel by air worldwide. Specifically, more than one million people travel by air, land, or sea into the United States alone. Verifying personal identities is of key importance to border security agents around the worldwide. This ensures that populations stay safe from threats that could endanger them. For all governments dealing with border security, it is imperative that they verify each person\u2019s identity using government databases. This will help them determine whether an individual is welcome into a country or not. Fast and accurate personal identity verification processes must be put in place to assist anyone responsible for the safe and legal passage of people across borders.  Human validators performing identity checks may not be considered (as) a best practice. Human review can lead to errors. Biased judgment should be discouraged in border agents verifying the identities of individuals traveling from all over the world. Humans are naturally prone to perform implicit bias. Human validators may express attitudes and stereotypes that affect their actions and decisions at an unconscious level. They may involuntarily make decisions without being aware of the bias taking place. These biases can be positive or negative in nature and every person is susceptible to them. This presents a unique challenge for effective law enforcement because it can alter how border agents interact with certain individuals and lead agent to draw false conclusions without their own awareness or ability to compensate.  In the United States, US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) claims that it takes around 20 seconds to verify a person\u2019s identity. In Hong Kong, it takes around 5 seconds to validate a person\u2019s identity as they travel into or out of mainland China. In both instances, where millions of people are crossing these borders every day, this is not fast enough. Border security personnel have a duty to ensure a reasonable flow of travelers through airport, seaport, and land-border checkpoints. Efforts must be made to increase current output at all border checkpoints and provide accurate checks on these travelers. Every second saved on verifying a single individual at a checkpoint translates into about a day\u2019s worth of labor each day for each year. Increase the savings to 10 seconds and that translates to about two weeks of saved labor. Saving this amount of time can free up border agents to perform other more meaningful tasks. The time saved during a routine identity verification that can easily be automated will allow border security personal to really spend the time on high risk individuals.  In airports all over the world, airport security personnel must tackle the challenge of security while meeting passenger demands. In such a dynamic border security environment, a standardized border control process must be put in place. Border security sector must keep in mind that customers, all eight million of them, expect an enhanced travel experience, which includes speed and accuracy while going through airport security checkpoints. New technologies are the answer to boosting the effectiveness of the border security process. security process. These technologies promise to decrease the labor for border agents, remove implicit bias and increase the speed of passing through border checkpoints. Biometric technologies can be incorporated into border security procedures to accurately confirm personal identities. These technologies are also supported by consumers and offer a low friction solution for identifying individuals.  Has an ecosystem of identity solutions aimed at increasing the efficiency of border control checkpoints. IDMscan is an identity verification and authentication solutions that provides next-generation identity verification. It scans identity documents\u2014passports, driver\u2019s licenses, national IDs\u2014to ensure they are valid documents. From there, it extracts the document data and connects to IDMkyc, a proprietary verification API. IDMkyc crosschecks the document data against data located in official data sources. After that, a biometric check takes place, further authenticating that a person really is who they say they are. This all happens in real-time, with minimal effort from the user. IDMkyc covers over 90 countries and includes identity data from some of the most challenging yet important countries, including: Brazil, India, China, and South Africa. IDMERIT was funded by experts who have been sourcing data on identities across the globe for over a decade. This access to official and trusted data can enhance the real-time PIV needs of border security agencies around the world. This comprehensive identity check will allow border agents to secure borders more accurately, effectively and with ease.

Our solution can help you establish the best practices of cryptocurrency compliance.", "keywords": ""}, "content": "Create trust in your cryptocurrency exchange with new technologies that help prevent disorder and theft.  Over the last 9 years, cryptocurrency has grown tremendously. Bitcoin used to be the only coin on the market, but today it shares the crypto market with 1800 other cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrency exchanges are on the rise as well, with 500 currently in existence. Despite this growth, there has not been a worldwide adoption of cryptocurrency. Consumers have demonstrated that while cryptocurrency is a great idea in theory, they do not automatically trust it. It goes back to the old saying, \u201cTrust is earned, not gained.\u201d Consumers want their investments and the personally identifiable information (PII) they share within a currency system to remain safe and secure. These objectives must be met to build trust for cryptocurrency among users and regulating entities. Without meeting these objectives, the worldwide adoption of a cryptocurrency system will continue to be scrutinized.  More and more regulation will be enforced by global governments into this new age of cryptocurrency. Therefore, time is a limiting factor. Soon enough, the norm will be for most exchanges to require identity verification for their customers. There are many reasons (for this) such as preventing money laundering and fraud. The most trusted exchanges follow identity verification process protocols for these reasons. Cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets want to experience the same trust as traditional financial services, but for this to happen exchanges must find a solution to identity verification. The problem is the traditional tedious process of identity verification. In the past, cryptocurrency exchanges have been compared to the wild west because of the disorder, theft, and shortage of lawmen to keep the peace abound. Running a trusted organization in this kind of environment can be a challenge. Being regulated, following compliance standards, and establishing legitimacy are keys for exchanges and cryptocurrencies to become mainstream industries. IDMERIT believes that identity verification plus compliance equals legitimate users and brand trust. These factors can help cryptocurrency exchanges develop a standard of excellence and build authority in a skeptical world.  By utilizing the most current best practices for identity verification, your customers can trust that you are protecting their interests and their investments. The loss that exchanges may suffer from fraud and stolen coins runs into billions of dollars in equivalent coins each year. Incurred loss from fraud and theft falls ultimately on the shoulders of your customers. By sealing off the loopholes for fraud through a suitable identity verification solution, you effectively prevent losses that would otherwise force you to increase the prices of your goods or services. The ultimate beneficiary of these security measures is being the customer. Onboarding legitimate and verified users can prevent Identity theft. Implementing an identity solution into your exchange is one of the most effective ways to ensure that your customers will not suffer this kind of fate, safeguarding the keeping them from unnecessary frustration.  There are many efforts being made to tame the wild west environment of cryptocurrency. Exchanges are targets for scandal and mistrust due to criminals potentially using exchanges to carry out illegal activities. An exchange that has been scandalized by theft and fraud cases will bear the risk of customer loss. An identity verification solution can prevent such indignities and help your exchange preserve its reputation. Regulatory obligations are growing. Cryptocurrency exchanges need to be sure they are complying with ever-growing rules and regulations. Failure to do so may amount to lawsuits and costly fines. IDMERIT\u2019sidentity verification solutionswill make regulatory compliance with identity verification frictionless and effortless, so your business will not run the risk of capturing misleading personal customer information. Consequently, it becomes easy for your business to remain compliant and mitigate risk with such legal requirements. Ultimately our solutions will help your exchange retain customer confidence and protect your business from fraud. Regulators believe that they should introduce Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) regulations to cryptocurrencies. They are under the impression that these regulations will help prevent criminals worldwide from performing nefarious activities like money laundering or terrorist financing. Some cryptocurrency advocates claim that regulation in the form of KYC and AML goes against the fundamental philosophies of blockchain. These advocates think that cryptocurrencies should remain anonymous and untraceable. Regulators find this argument exhausting because it makes it more difficult for them to prevent and monitor (for) crime within the crypto space.   Regulation for crypto exchanges would not go against the fundamental nature of the currency. In fact, crypto regulation would benefit exchanges and users in a variety of different ways. It would increase the flow of institutional capital into crypto markets. It would also strengthen corporate governance in crypto companies. Crypto exchanges would be legitimate entities and be subject to the same rights and benefits as other legal institutions. In theory, crypto consumers should feel more secure knowing their interests are protected by regulators. Plus, crypto consumers would experience more transaction freedom if regulations were put into place. Currently, many exchanges put limits on the amount of crypto that can be transferred to fiat money in unverified customer accounts. If all crypto exchanges were regulated, these types of hindrances to consumers would not exist.  Customer onboarding begins with the sign-up process, but if this process is tedious and time-consuming you will lose that customers interest, thus causing increases in customer abandonment. The bottom line is lost revenue. The effort required to sign up > Perceived value to customer = Onboard abandonment. Reduce the effort required to sign up. Increase perceived value.  In these cases, we can verify your customers with 70-99% using one or more of these additional data points. We have structured our verification solution to follow a step-by-step information collection of PII, so you minimize the friction and make onboarding an effortless, easy process for your customers. With our solution, most (of your) customers will only need to provide one or two pieces of PII for successful identity verification. IDMERIT offers a comprehensive ecosystem of global identity verification solutions. These solutions can help you establish the best practices of KYC, AML, fraud prevention and, due diligence. You can approve buy/sell limits and keep currency moving by quickly by accurately identifying legitimate customers and keeping out criminals.

The problems facing financial institutions are endless. The ability to verify customers in real-time and comply with a myriad of regulations \u2013 including know your customer (KYC), anti-money laundering (AML), Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC), and customer identification program (CIP) \u2013 is now paramount. Additionally, you must constantly take steps to mitigate reputational, financial, and operational risks. When KYC and AML procedures were put into place with the Patriot Act, regulators purposely did not mandate specific standards that should be used to verify customers. They did this on purpose, fearing that if specific rules were put into place that banks would only ever strive to meet the minimum requirements. This has led financial institutions, out of fear of massive fines, to create individualized procedures and requirements for conducting due diligence. The documents needed to meet identity verification standards for KYC vary from bank to bank. Some banks require passports, while other ask for utility bills and bank statements. Corporations may need to include all their directors\u2019 information, like names, dates of birth, or legal and tax documentation. Since this varies from bank to bank, this makes the KYC process extremely slow and difficult for individuals looking to receive financial services. While the need for KYC and AML procedures remains strong, they create a burden to financial institutions. It has been reported that the costs associated with maintaining KYC and AML compliance include These statistics have raised concerns about the costs associated with KYC and AML compliance. It has many people wondering if banks are being overburdened to the point that they are unable to perform their other daily functions. Introducing technologies to help automate KYC and AML compliance will help reduce the stress financial institutions are currently facing.  No industry sector experiences more fraud than the finance industry. The costs are in the trillions \u2013 and likely to rise as criminals and thieves find even more sophisticated ways to steal money. Withdata breaches increasing by as much as 44.7%, identity theft is on the rise as well. In an industry in which both technology and crime evolves daily, you need solutions that always keep you one step ahead of criminals and protect your customers. In order to prevent criminals from using the tools provided by the financial industry, it\u2019s critical that banks perform customer risk ratings during the onboarding process. Using technology to automate this system provides several benefits. Some believe that customer risk assessment is most beneficial when conducted at the beginning of a custmer relationship. Others argue that it is most beneficial throughout a customer relationship because the risk assessment has actual transaction data attached to it. Regardless, customers should be monitored frequently throughout their relationship with a financial institution.  Financial institutions usually perform three types of customer screening:  These questions should be examined when deciding to purchase or subscribe identity verification solution: IDMERIT provides a comprehensive set of identity verification solutions that could assist in meeting compliance standards for banks and financial institutions.
